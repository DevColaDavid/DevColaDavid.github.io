        answer: 0,
        solution: "If Moana ate more than the sum of everyone is pancake and to find the least value of pancake Moana ate we need to find the sum of everyone is eaten pan cake. However, it is just a sum but moana ate more so the least value we can add here is 1 so we add 15 and 1 then We get answer 16",
